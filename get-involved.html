				<p>On behalf of Ace Racing, the team leader, Andreas Economides and the sponsorship manager, Mina-Christina Koullapi, call for your support in our efforts to take part in this competition. Proceeds from all sponsorships will be used for our entry in the competition, as well as essentials such as building material, transportation fees, manufacturing services, and team clothing, exclusively for use within the competition.</p>
				<p>Each sponsorship tier comes with its own rewards, ranging from logos on the team uniform, to your company logo on our car. Marketing and social media play a big role in the sponsorships, as the appropriate advertisement will be conducted equivalent to the tier chosen. Exposure will be on a national level at first, and if we achieve victory in the national finals and qualify for the world finals, then advertisement will be conducted to a much broader audience on a global scale.</p>
				<p>Sponsorships can also be in the form of goods and services relevant to the team’s needs, and can be negotiated and allocated accordingly to each sponsorship tier. If you wish to purchase a high-tier package, we can arrange it so that you give us 25%-50% of the money for the nationals, and if we qualify for the internationals the payment can be completed fully. Please note that if you choose this option, the rewards will have full effect for the whole duration of the team’s involvement in the competition.</p>
