										<h3>The Competition</h3>
										<p class="justified">The competition is organized annually by 'Formula One in Schools Ltd'. Even though Cyprus is new on the stage, our school has introduced and pioneered the program in Cyprus, and leads as an example to the rest of the island's schools. The competition calls for innovative ideas, critical thinking and enterpreneurship, which inspires us to expand our knowledge on the fields of project management, physics, aerodynamics, design, scoial media, and most importantly, teamwork. This year, Cyprus will be having its own national finals and we are excited to compete. If our team qualifies, we will be representing our island in the world finals in Malaysia later this year.</p>
